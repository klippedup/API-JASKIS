This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

Creating my Dream vintage clothing website with all my personal articles of clothing,
Integrating Sanity.io as an easy way for keeping record of products and prices.
Ran into a few technical errors with checkout and with authorization and authentication but i will continue to work on it and fix.
